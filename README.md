# GRPC Core Infra

This Infra provides constructs to enable GRPC interfaces better along with
potentially auto generating code constructs as required, following the
motivation from gRPC-Gateway.

Initial Outlook is to at least have following capabilities:
- Autogenerate Routes and RBAC Definitions
- Autogenerate Client SDKs
